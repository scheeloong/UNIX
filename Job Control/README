myspin.c	# Takes argument <n> and spins for <n> seconds
mysplit.c	# Forks a child that spins for <n> seconds
mystop.c	# Spins for <n> seconds and sends SIGTSTP to itself

# This program is basically a shell program I had to write 
# in C/UNIX and to make sure it handles signals properly. 

# To run the program, simply run: 
# >> make clean
# >> make
# >> make test01 
# >> make test02
# >> ..........(repeat similarly to test other functionalities of the shell) 
# >> make test17
